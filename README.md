Let's break down the provided Python code step by step:

```python
import pyqrcode
from datetime import datetime
```

Here, the code begins by importing two modules: `pyqrcode` and `datetime`. The `pyqrcode` module is used for generating QR codes, and the `datetime` module is used for working with dates and times.

```python
url = input("enter the url  : ")
```

The `input` function is used to take user input. The user is prompted to enter a URL, and the entered value is stored in the variable `url`.

```python
print(f"generating qr code for {url} .... ")
```

A message is then printed to the console, indicating that a QR code is being generated for the provided URL.

```python
today_date = datetime.now().date()
```

The `datetime.now()` function is used to get the current date and time, and `.date()` extracts only the date portion. The obtained date is then stored in the variable `today_date`.

```python
qr = pyqrcode.create(url)
```

The `pyqrcode.create()` function is called with the provided URL (`url`) as an argument, creating a QR code object. This object is assigned to the variable `qr`.

```python
qr.png(f"{today_date}.png", scale=8)
```

Finally, the `png` method of the QR code object is called to generate a PNG image of the QR code. The method takes two arguments: the filename for the generated image (constructed using the current date and the file extension `.png`), and the scale of the QR code (set to 8 in this case).

In summary, this Python script takes a URL as user input, generates a QR code for that URL using the `pyqrcode` library, and saves the QR code as a PNG image file with a filename based on the current date.
